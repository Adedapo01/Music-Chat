## Overview
### Description
Spotify-like app where people can create a playlist or listen to any music. It will also have a chat activity where people can send messages, share music and listen to specific music at the same time.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Music / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** It will primarily be for Mobile because people usually listen to music on their phones and will be of easier access to chat and share music anytime and anywhere.
- **Story:** People can listen to specific music and add the music they like to a playlist. They can also share music with the people they want to and listen to specific music at the same time.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they listen to music and how willing they are to share music and playlists in chat.
- **Scope:** First, users will start with listening to music, then they can add the music to a playlist and/or share it with other users. They can also chat with users they share music too, then perhaps this could evolve into an app that allows multiple users to listen to the same music at the same time. Large potential for use with Spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
